excerpt: 'Machine translation(MT) quality estimation(QE) is a crucial task to estimate the quality of MT outputs when reference translations are unavailable. 
Many studies focus on generating pseudo data using large parallel corpus and achieve remarkable success in the supervised setting.
However, pseudo data solutions are less satisfying in unsupervised scenarios because the pseudo labels are inaccurate or the pseudo translations differ from the real ones. 
To address these problems, we propose to generate pseudo data using the MT model with constrained beam search~(CBSQE).
CBSQE preserves the reference parts with high MT probabilities as correct translations, while the rest parts as the wrong ones for MT generation.
Therefore, CBSQE can reduce the false negative labels caused by synonyms.
Overall, beam search will prefer a more real hypothesis with a higher MT generation likelihood.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBSQE outperforms strong baselines in both supervised and unsupervised settings.
Analyses further show the superiority of CBSQE.'
