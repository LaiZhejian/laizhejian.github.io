I received my B.Sc. degree from [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2023, and during my undergraduate years, I actively participated in several <strong>Programming Contest</strong>, including ICPC and CCPC. Furthermore, I was honored to be admitted to pursue my M.Sc. degree at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) without entrance examination. Currently, I am a member of the [NJUNLP Group](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/), working under the supervision of Prof. [Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/).
